Inheritance
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class
(subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an
existing class (superclass or base class).

-In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword to indicate that one class inherits
from another.

-Subclasses inherit all accessible members (fields and methods) of their superclass,
except for constructors and private members, which are not inherited but can be accessed through
public or protected methods.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, here are the key points about inheritance listed:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Code Reusability
2.  Relationships
3.  Hierarchy
4.  Extensibility
5.  Polymorphism
6.  Access Control
7.  Constructor Chaining
8.  Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces)
9. Superclass and Subclass Relationship

Types of inheritance
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Single Inheritance: One class extends another class.

2. Multilevel Inheritance: A chain of inheritance with multiple levels.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single class.

4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces): A class implements multiple interfaces.

5. Hybrid Inheritance (Through Interfaces): Combines different inheritance types using interfaces.
