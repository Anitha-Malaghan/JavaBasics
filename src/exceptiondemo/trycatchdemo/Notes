Exception:
- An exception in Java is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution.

- It is an object that is thrown at runtime when an abnormal condition arises in the program,
  such as an error, that the regular code cannot handle.

- Exceptions are used to handle errors and other exceptional events in a structured way,
  allowing the program to continue running or terminate gracefully.

Key Components of Structured Error Handling in Java
------------------------------------------------------

1. Try Block: Encapsulates the code that might throw an exception.

2. Catch Block: Contains the code to handle the exception if one occurs.

3. Finally Block: Contains code that will always execute after the try and catch blocks,
regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught.

4. Throw Statement: Used to explicitly throw an exception.

5. Throws Clause: Declares that a method might throw certain exceptions,
informing callers of the potential need to handle these exceptions.(ChatGPT)
